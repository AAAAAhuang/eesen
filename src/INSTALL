These instructions are valid for UNIX-like systems. Installation on Windows is not supported currently.

1. Requirements:

A. You must first have completed the installation of Kaldi dependencies (OpenFST, ATLAS, etc.). Go to
   your EESEN root dir.
   
   - If you have installed Kaldi, simply link (or copy) /path/to/kaldi/tools here. No additional packages are needed.

   - Otherwise, check out Kaldi's tools dir and install the dependencies:
     > svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/kaldi/code/trunk/tools tools
     > cd tools
     > make
     In case you don't have ATLAS installed, then installation can be done:
     > ./install_atlas.sh

B. Model training in EESEN only supports GPU currently. Therefore, you must have an GPU card and
   have installed NVIDIA cuda driver. You need to specify the path to the CUDA library for ./configure



2. Installation

./configure --use-cuda=yes --cudatk-dir=/path/to/cuda_library
make depend
make
