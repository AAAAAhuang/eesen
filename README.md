# Eesen

Eesen is a framework and open-source toolkit to build end-to-end speech recognition (ASR) systems. The goal of Eesen is to simplify the existing complicated ASR pipeline into a sequence-to-sequence learning problem. Eesen is a spin-off of the popular [Kaldi](http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/) toolkit, and has been developed by [Yajie Miao](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ymiao) from Carnegie Mellon University.
